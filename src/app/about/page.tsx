      <p>
        I have almost 3 years experience of work in Cyber Security Governance in
        the largest Investment Bank of LatAm, focusing on CRI management and
        secure development of web applications to manage a wide range of
        operations inside a governance team.

      <p>
        My daily stack includes TypeScript, React, Next.js and AWS services
        (Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront, WAF, S3). I also integrate Python for
        backend automation and analysis.

        Also, along with Software Engineering activities, I follow and assist
        with all life cycle of Cyber Risks issued in those applications. My main
        role in these CRIs is to facilitate the solutions with all teams that
        are responsible and/or involved in the risk, making sure that all
        possible measures are being taken with the celerity needed for each risk
        level.
